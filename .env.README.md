# Environment Configuration Files

This project has different `.env` files for different environments:

## Files:

1. **`.env`** - Default (Used for Kubernetes/Production builds)
   - Uses relative paths (`/api`)
   - Nginx proxies requests to backend

2. **`.env.development`** - For local development
   - Uses `http://localhost:5050/api`
   - Direct connection to backend

3. **`.env.production`** - For production builds
   - Same as default `.env`
   - Uses relative paths for nginx proxy

## Usage:

### For Kubernetes/Production:
```bash
npm run build
# Uses .env by default
```

### For Local Development:
```bash
# Option 1: Use docker-compose (environment variables defined in docker-compose.yml)
docker-compose up

# Option 2: Run locally without docker
cp .env.development .env.local
npm start
```

### For Docker Build (Cloud):
The Dockerfile copies `.env` into the build, which has production settings.

## Note:
- **Don't commit `.env.local`** - it's in `.gitignore`
- **Docker-compose** overrides with its own environment variables
- **Kubernetes builds** should use the default `.env` (relative paths)
