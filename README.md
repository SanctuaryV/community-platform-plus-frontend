# Community Platform Plus - Frontend# Community Platform Plus - Frontend



A modern React-based frontend application for the Community Platform Plus system, providing an intuitive user interface for community interaction and management.A modern React-based frontend application for the Community Platform Plus project.



## üåü Features## Project Overview



- **Modern React Architecture**: Built with Create React App for optimal performanceThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and serves as the user interface for the Community Platform Plus system.

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Material-UI components

- **Real-time Communication**: Chat and messaging functionality## Available Scripts

- **User Management**: Profile management and authentication

- **Community Features**: Post creation, community browsing, and interactionIn the project directory, you can run:

- **Security Integration**: Built-in security scanning and vulnerability assessment

### `npm start`

## üöÄ Quick Start

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### PrerequisitesOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- Node.js (v14 or higher)

- npm or yarnThe page will reload when you make changes.\

- Docker (for containerization)You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### Installation### `npm test`



1. **Clone the repository**Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

   ```bashSee the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

   git clone https://github.com/SanctuaryV/community-platform-plus-frontend.git

   cd community-platform-plus-frontend### `npm run build`

   ```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

2. **Install dependencies**It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

   ```bash

   npm installThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

   ```Your app is ready to be deployed!



3. **Start development server**See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

   ```bash

   npm start### `npm run eject`

   ```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

4. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.



## üìú Available ScriptsInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.



### DevelopmentYou don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode

- `npm test` - Launches the test runner## Learn More

- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production

- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (‚ö†Ô∏è irreversible)You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).



### ProductionTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

The project uses Jenkins for automated build and deployment:

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Clone Repository** - Fetch latest codeThis project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment with the following features:

2. **Install Dependencies** - npm install

3. **Security Scan** - Checkmarx SAST (optional)### Pipeline Stages

4. **Build Docker Image** - Container creation- **Clone Repository**: Fetches the latest code from GitHub

5. **Push to Registry** - Google Artifact Registry (optional)- **Install Dependencies**: Runs `npm install` to install project dependencies

- **SAST - Checkmarx**: Optional security scanning (when enabled)
